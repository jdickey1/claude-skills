# Writing

Universal writing standards for all content. Format-specific guidance in references/.

## Universal Rules (ALL Content Must Follow)

### 1. No Em Dashes (CRITICAL)

NEVER use em dashes in any content. This is the #1 tell of AI-generated text.

- Wrong: `The datacenter -- which opened last year -- is expanding.`
- Right: `The datacenter, which opened last year, is expanding.`

Use commas, periods, colons, semicolons, or parentheses instead. No exceptions.

### 2. Banned AI Buzzwords

These words are immediate AI detection flags. Replace on sight:

| Banned | Use Instead |
|--------|------------|
| delve | dig into, explore |
| landscape | space, world, field |
| leverage | use |
| robust | strong, [specific descriptor] |
| streamline | simplify |
| moreover / furthermore | Plus, Also, or omit |
| ensure | make sure |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| utilize | use |
| holistic | complete, full |
| synergy | [describe the actual benefit] |
| paradigm | model, approach |
| ecosystem | system, network |
| myriad | many, countless |
| underscore | highlight, show |
| notably | [just state the thing] |
| comprehensive | thorough, complete |
| In today's digital age | [delete entirely] |
| It is essential to note | [delete entirely] |

### 3. Use Contractions

Avoiding contractions is one of the most obvious AI fingerprints. Use them naturally: don't, can't, won't, isn't, it's, doesn't, wouldn't, hasn't.

### 4. Vary Sentence Rhythm

Evenly-paced paragraphs (every sentence 15-25 words) read as machine-generated. Mix it up:

- Short punch. Then a longer sentence that develops the idea with context and nuance. Fragment for impact.
- Vary openers. Don't start consecutive sentences the same way.
- Real writers speed up and slow down. So should you.

### 5. Specificity Over Generality

- Wrong: "Water is scarce in Texas."
- Right: "The Ogallala Aquifer in the Permian Basin is depleting 150+ feet below sustainable levels."

Specific numbers, names, places, and examples beat abstract claims every time.

### 6. Active Voice Preferred

- Wrong: "Gas generation is permitted in Texas."
- Right: "Texas permits gas generation."

### 7. Show, Don't Preach

- Don't talk down to the reader
- Don't over-explain obvious things
- Let evidence make your case, not admonishments
- Trust the reader's intelligence

### 8. Evidence After Claims

Every assertion should be followed within 1-2 sentences by proof: a number, an example, a story, or a comparison. Unsupported claims read as filler.

### 9. Headlines Are 80% of the Work (CRITICAL)

David Ogilvy: "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy." 80% of readers never get past the headline. Everything else is downstream.

- Always write 5+ headline candidates before selecting one
- Use numbers (+36% engagement), brackets (+40% CTR), specificity (+321% conversion)
- Test headline length for channel: 6 words general, 8 words landing pages, 2-4 words email
- Negative superlatives ("worst," "never") outperform positive by 30%

## Hook Patterns (Universal)

The first line of anything has one job: stop the scroll. Patterns that work:

1. **Specific number + surprising claim**: "$178B fork in the road for Texas energy"
2. **Contrarian take with evidence**: "I analyzed 100 accounts. 83% posted LESS than experts recommend."
3. **Quotable provocation**: "Power gets the headlines. Water will get the lawsuits."
4. **Curiosity gap**: Reveal enough to create tension, not enough to resolve it.

End strong too. The last line triggers shares and reposts. Don't bury your best line in the middle.
