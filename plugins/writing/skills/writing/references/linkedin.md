## Algorithm Priorities (Ranked)

1. **Comments are #1**: More important than likes or shares
2. Posts with early comments trend into 2nd/3rd-degree connection feeds
3. Carousel posts generate highest engagement
4. Document attachments and video also high-performing
5. Personal stories with professional takeaways drive best engagement

## Post Best Practices

### The Hook (First 140 Characters)

LinkedIn truncates after ~140 characters behind "see more." Your hook must earn the click. For headline formulas and research, see [headlines.md](headlines.md).

Strong hook types:
- **Direct question**: Makes reader reflect on their own experience
- **Surprising data**: Grabs attention, adds credibility
- **Bold one-liner**: Sparks conversation

### Structure

```
[Hook: bold statement, surprising data, or direct question]

[Context: 2-3 paragraphs developing the insight]
[Use line breaks heavily for readability]

[Evidence: specific example, case study, or data point]

[Actionable takeaway or discussion prompt]

#RelevantTag1 #RelevantTag2 #RelevantTag3
```

### Length & Formatting

- 150-250 words for standard posts (sweet spot for engagement)
- Heavy line breaks (LinkedIn readers scan, not read)
- Bold key phrases for visual hierarchy
- 3-5 relevant hashtags (LinkedIn search does use them, unlike X)

### Tone

- Professional but not corporate/boring
- Analytical, thorough, evidence-based
- Personal stories welcome when tied to professional insight
- Questions at the end work well here (unlike X)
- No mocking, no hot takes without substance

## Article Best Practices

- Lead with clear, specific headline
- Use subheadings, bullet points, short paragraphs for skimmers
- Include visuals: cover image + at least one inline (chart, screenshot)
- Promote articles with dedicated posts driving traffic
- Articles get indexed by search engines (SEO value)

## Posting Strategy

- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best time**: 9 AM - 12 PM in audience timezone
- **Frequency**: 1 per day max (quality over quantity)
- **Kickstart**: Share new posts with colleagues first to generate early comments
- Video posts see ~3x follower growth

## Platform Tone: X vs LinkedIn

| Element | X | LinkedIn |
|---------|---|---------|
| Length | 280 chars ideal | 1000-2000 words |
| Tone | Sharp, opinionated, punchy | Professional, analytical, thorough |
| Opening | Specific claim or surprise | Context-setting headline |
| Closing | Quotable one-liner | Question inviting comments |
| Links | Self-reply only | Inline (no penalization) |
| Hashtags | Skip | 3-5 relevant tags |
| @ Mentions | Every post with named entities | Tag company pages |

Same insight needs completely different packaging per platform. LinkedIn's "Here's what you need to know about..." becomes X's specific, surprising claim.
