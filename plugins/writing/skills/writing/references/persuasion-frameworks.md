# Persuasion & Copywriting Frameworks

## When to Use Each Framework

| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| PAS | Urgent needs, pain-point decisions | Problem, Agitate, Solve |
| BAB | Transformation narratives | Before, After, Bridge |
| AIDA | General marketing, ads | Attention, Interest, Desire, Action |
| FAB | Product-focused copy | Features, Advantages, Benefits |
| 4Ps | Landing pages, sales pages | Promise, Picture, Proof, Push |

## PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

The workhorse of direct response. Works when the reader has a felt problem.

1. **Problem**: Name the pain precisely. Be specific enough that they think "that's me."
2. **Agitate**: Intensify. Show the cost of not solving it. Make the status quo uncomfortable.
3. **Solve**: Present your solution as the natural resolution.

Example:
> Your team spends 6 hours a week formatting reports manually. That's 312 hours a year, enough to build an entire product feature. [Solution] automates report formatting in 3 clicks.

## BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

Stronger than PAS when selling transformation (coaching, tech, lifestyle).

1. **Before**: Reader's current reality (problems they may not fully recognize)
2. **After**: The transformed state they want
3. **Bridge**: How your solution gets them there

Example:
> **Before**: You're posting content daily but engagement is flat. Followers trickle in.
> **After**: Your posts consistently get 50+ comments. DMs from prospects arrive weekly.
> **Bridge**: The difference isn't volume. It's structure. Here's the framework...

## AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

The classic. Still works for ads and short-form marketing.

1. **Attention**: Stop the scroll (headline, hook, visual)
2. **Interest**: Engage with relevant information
3. **Desire**: Create wanting (benefits, social proof, scarcity)
4. **Action**: Clear CTA

## FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)

For product descriptions and comparison content.

- **Feature**: What it is (technical spec)
- **Advantage**: What it does (functional improvement)
- **Benefit**: What it means for the reader (outcome they care about)

Example:
> **Feature**: 256-bit AES encryption
> **Advantage**: Your data can't be read even if intercepted
> **Benefit**: You can send confidential client documents without worrying about breaches

## 4Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)

For landing pages and sales pages.

1. **Promise**: Bold headline promise (specific outcome)
2. **Picture**: Help reader visualize the result
3. **Proof**: Testimonials, data, case studies
4. **Push**: Urgency + clear CTA

## 7 Service Framing Patterns

From real-world B2B service positioning:

1. **Efficiency Frame**: Problem, Solution, Outcome. Addresses time/cost objections.
2. **Results Frame**: Lead with proof and specific outcomes. Creates urgency.
3. **Platform Frame**: Channel-first positioning. Speaks to how audience consumes.
4. **Transparency Frame**: Value-first, price-last. Itemize services, anchor to higher price.
5. **Confidence Frame**: Emotional/psychological. Address fear or uncertainty.
6. **Leverage Frame**: Scale/multiplication. Show ROI over time.
7. **Simplicity Frame**: Remove friction. Make the ask feel small.

## Classic Direct Response Principles

### Eugene Schwartz
- Tap into desires already present in the audience's mind
- Understand the 5 stages of market awareness (unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware, most-aware)
- Match your copy to where the audience sits on that spectrum

### David Ogilvy
- Respect your audience's intelligence
- Research before writing
- Headlines do 80% of the work. Test 20 alternatives. (See [headlines.md](headlines.md) for complete research and formulas.)
- Specifics sell. "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock."

### Gary Halbert
- Write like you talk
- The list (audience) and the offer matter more than the copy
- Specific beats generic every single time
- The best copy in the world can't sell a bad offer

## The Argument Builder (Long-Form Structure)

For persuasive articles and essays:

1. **HOOK**: Surprising stat, story, or question that makes your thesis feel inevitable
2. **PROBLEM**: What's broken and why it matters (include costs/consequences)
3. **CURRENT SOLUTIONS**: Why existing approaches fail (be fair but critical)
4. **THESIS**: Your argument in one clear sentence
5. **EVIDENCE**: 3-5 supporting points with data, expert opinion, examples, logic
6. **COUNTERARGUMENTS**: Address the 2 strongest objections head-on
7. **IMPLICATIONS**: What changes if you're right?
8. **CALL TO ACTION**: What should the reader do now?

## Content Remix Quick Reference

One piece of source content can become:

| Format | Length | Tone Adaptation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| X post | 280 chars | Sharp, punchy, provocative |
| X thread | 7-10 tweets | One point per tweet, hook first |
| LinkedIn post | 150-250 words | Professional, analytical |
| Blog post | 800-2000 words | Thorough, structured, SEO-aware |
| Email newsletter | 250-500 words | Direct, scannable, CTA-focused |
| Executive summary | 3 paragraphs | Dense, no fluff, decision-ready |
| Pull quotes | 1-2 sentences each | Quotable, shareable |

Same insight. Different packaging. Always adapt tone to platform.
