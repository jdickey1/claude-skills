# Headlines, Titles & Headings

## Why This Is the Most Important Part of Any Content

David Ogilvy: *"On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."*

Modern data confirms this: **80% of people read headlines, only 20% read body copy.** A 500% difference in performance between great and average headlines is common. Everything else you write is downstream of the headline.

## Hard Statistics

### Headlines With Numbers

- **36% higher engagement** than headlines without numbers (Conductor)
- **73% more social shares** on numbered headlines (BuzzSumo)
- **20% higher CTR** from odd numbers (7, 9) vs even numbers (8, 10)
- Best-performing numbers: 10, 5, 15, 7
- Use numerals ("10") not words ("ten")

### Headline Length

| Length | Performance | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 6 words | Optimal comprehension | General (readers absorb first 3 + last 3 words) |
| 8 words | +21% conversion | Landing pages (Guardian study) |
| 12-14 words | High engagement | Facebook, long-form |
| 55-70 chars | Best organic CTR | Google titles (truncates at ~63) |
| 2-4 words | Highest open rate | Email subject lines |

### Emotional Impact

- **Negative superlatives ("worst," "never") perform 30% better** than positive ones ("best," "always")
- Each negative word increases CTR by ~2.3%
- Each positive word *decreases* clicks by ~1%
- Emotional subject lines: ~31% engagement vs ~16% for rational
- Urgency signals: +22% more email opens

### Format Elements That Boost CTR

| Element | CTR Boost |
|---------|----------|
| Numbers in title | +36% |
| Brackets in title | +40% |
| Questions in title | +14.1% |
| Emotional statements | +7%+ |
| Emoji (email) | +73% open rate improvement |

## Headline Formulas That Work

### The Specificity Formula

```
[NUMBER] + [ADJECTIVE] + [TARGET KEYWORD] + [RATIONALE/PROMISE]
```

Examples:
- "5 Proven Tactics Professional Salespeople Use to Close 40% More Deals"
- "The 14-Day Email Sequence That Generated $150K in Revenue"

### The Curiosity Gap

Reveal enough to create tension, not enough to resolve it. Make the reader aware of what they don't know.

- "Why 73% of Marketers Are Still Writing Boring Headlines"
- "The One Thing BuzzFeed Tests 25 Times Per Article"

**Curiosity gap vs clickbait**: A headline is a promise. Curiosity gaps deliver on the promise. Clickbait doesn't. Break the promise often and readers stop coming back.

### The Value Stack

Combine multiple benefits to increase perceived value beyond the sum of parts.

- Before: "How to Create a Welcome Sequence"
- After: "How to Create a Welcome Sequence That Converts, Prevents Churn, and Seeds Sales"

### The Contrarian Statement

Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence.

- "Consistency Is Killing Your Newsletter"
- "Stop A/B Testing Your Headlines (Do This Instead)"

### The Specific Result

Lead with a concrete, verifiable outcome.

- "This 3-Line Email Subject Doubled My Open Rate"
- "How We Cut Bounce Rate by 47% With One Page Change"

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Email Subject Lines

- 47% of people decide to open based solely on subject line
- 69% report as spam based on subject line alone
- Most people decide in less than one second
- Best length: 2-4 words consistently outperform longer
- Custom preheader text: +13.7% open rate improvement

### Blog Post / SEO Titles

- Title length 40-60 characters: best organic CTR
- Position #1 in Google gets 74.5% more clicks than #2
- Clear, direct headlines: +38% more engagement than vague titles
- Action-oriented copy: +93% conversion
- Benefit-driven vs feature-driven: +85% conversion

### Social Media Headlines

- 6-8 words optimal for engagement
- 70-100 characters for maximum sharing
- Platform-native language (X is punchy, LinkedIn is analytical)

### Newsletter Headlines

- Average Substack open rate: ~50%
- High performers hit 70%+
- Headlines and subheadings directly drive open rates

## The Testing Imperative

### How Top Publishers Test

- **Upworthy**: Up to 25 headlines per article (32,487 experiments archived)
- **BuzzFeed**: A/B tests headlines, numbers, and thumbnails simultaneously; winners emerge in 2-3 hours
- **Ogilvy's rule**: Test 20 alternative headlines per ad

### Minimum Testing Practice

- Always write 5+ headline candidates before selecting
- A/B test at least 2 variants when traffic allows
- Test one element at a time (length, number, emotion, format)
- Run tests 1-2 weeks minimum for statistical significance
- Target 95% confidence (p-value 0.05)

### What to Test (Priority Order)

1. **Specificity**: Vague vs specific (biggest impact)
2. **Benefit framing**: Feature vs benefit
3. **Number inclusion**: With vs without
4. **Emotional tone**: Positive vs negative
5. **Length**: Short vs medium vs long
6. **Format**: Question vs statement vs how-to

## Common Headline Mistakes

1. **Vague/generic**: "How to Improve Your Life" (improve what? whose life?)
2. **Feature-focused**: Readers buy benefits, not features
3. **Too clever**: Clarity beats cleverness every time. If the reader has to think about what you mean, you've lost them.
4. **Missing the benefit**: Answer "why should I care?" in the headline itself
5. **Wrong length for channel**: 8 words on email, 6 on social, 55 chars for Google
6. **No testing**: The first headline idea is almost never the best one

## Quick Decision: What Headline Approach to Use

| Context | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Search/SEO | Concrete, benefit-driven, 40-60 chars, include keyword |
| Social/discovery | Curiosity gap, emotional trigger, 6-8 words |
| Email | Urgency + specificity + benefit, 2-4 words ideal |
| Newsletter | Value stack or contrarian, 8-14 words |
| Landing page | Specific result + number, 8 words |
| Ad copy | AIDA hook, test 20+ variants |
