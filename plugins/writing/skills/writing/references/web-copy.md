# Website Copy & Blog Posts

## Modern Web Copywriting (2025-2026)

The shift: Away from "keyword stuff to rank" toward "write for humans first, optimize second." 80% of consumers now resolve 40% of searches without clicking (zero-click searches). Winners write copy that converts, not just ranks.

## Headlines That Convert

> **This is the most important section.** 80% of readers never get past the headline. For the full research, formulas, and testing methodology, see [headlines.md](headlines.md).

**Formula**: Numbers + Adjective + Target Keyword + Rationale + Promise

Examples:
- "5 Proven Tactics Professional Salespeople Use to Close 40% More Deals"
- "The 14-Day Email Sequence That Generated $150K in Revenue"

Research-backed headline statistics:
- Numbers in headlines: +30% conversion
- 8-word headlines: +21% conversion
- Action-oriented copy: +93% conversion
- Benefit-driven vs feature-driven: +85% conversion
- Specific outcomes: +321% conversion

Test 20 alternatives per headline (Ogilvy's rule). The first idea is rarely the best.

## Content Structure for Scanning

Users read only 20-28% of blog text. Structure for skimming:

- **Single H1** per page (main title, include primary keyword)
- **H2s** divide into clear sections (readers jump to what they need)
- **H3s** break down H2 sections into specifics
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Bullet points for key information
- White space is critical for visual hierarchy

Articles with H2 and H3 subheadings see **36% higher performance** in traffic, shares, and backlinks.

## SEO Without Sacrificing Readability

- Write first (for humans), optimize second (for search)
- Focus on EEAT: Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness
- Keywords fit naturally, never forced
- Answer the search intent fully (what is the reader actually looking for?)
- Include specific, actionable information
- AI search optimization matters now: structure content so AI can extract clear answers

## CTAs That Convert

**Requirements:**
- Visual prominence (stands out on page)
- Specific clarity (tell them exactly what happens after click)
- Action verbs: Get, Start, Claim, Learn, Download, Discover

**Impact data:**
- Single well-placed CTA: +371% click-through
- Personalized CTAs: +42% over standard
- Behavior-based dynamic CTAs: +44% boost

**Examples:**
- "Get instant access to our free report"
- "Start your free 7-day trial today"
- "Claim your 20% discount before midnight"

## Service Page Structure

For service/practice area pages:

1. **H1**: [Service] + [Location] (e.g., "Estate Planning Attorney in The Woodlands, TX")
2. **Opening**: What the reader is dealing with + how you solve it
3. **Process section**: Step-by-step what working with you looks like (transparency wins)
4. **Types/Options**: Compare approaches so reader can self-qualify
5. **Cost transparency**: Address pricing honestly (competitors avoid this, readers want it)
6. **Social proof**: Reviews, case studies, credentials
7. **FAQ**: Address objections as questions
8. **CTA**: Clear next step with specific outcome
