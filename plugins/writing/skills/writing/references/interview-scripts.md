# Interview Script Writing Rules

Standards for podcast and video interview scripts. Derived from editorial revisions on Winning on Issues scripts (Gleeson, Wright, Miller, et al.). Apply to all interview-format content including Winning on Issues and Hyperscale News.

## Foundational Rules (Non-negotiable)

### 1. Remove Interviewer Interpretation from Guest Bios

Don't insert editorial judgment into introductions. Let credentials stand on their own.

- Wrong: "giving him a rare combination of operational depth and Capitol fluency"
- Right: State the roles. The interview will demonstrate the combination.

### 2. No Defensive Framing in Introductions

Cut shield language that implies prior doubt about the guest's legitimacy.

- Wrong: "Chairman Gleeson isn't an outside appointee learning on the job."
- Wrong: "The Texas Senate confirmed him unanimously."
- Right: State the appointment. Move on.

If baggage exists, address it directly in a question, not defensively in the bio.

### 3. No Editorial Commentary Between Premise and Question

Remove the host's opinion from between the setup and the ask.

- Wrong: "you told Senator Paxton that restoring trust was your priority. That's a striking admission. Where specifically..."
- Right: "you told Senator Paxton that restoring trust was your priority. What have you been able to accomplish toward that goal?"

Phrases to cut: "That's striking," "That's remarkable," "That's controversial," "That's a bold claim."

### 4. One Question Per Slot

Don't stack two questions into one turn. The guest will answer whichever is easier and skip the harder one.

- Wrong: "Where did trust break down, AND what have you done to earn it back?"
- Right: "What have you been able to accomplish toward that goal?"

If both questions matter, ask them in separate turns.

### 5. No Clarifying Disclaimers

Don't patch an unclear question with "I mean this, not that" coaching.

- Wrong: "What would Texans see that's different? Not what's been legislated or planned, but what's actually operational today?"
- Right: "What would Texans see that's different? What's operational today that wasn't in February 2021?"

If the question needs a disclaimer, rewrite it instead.

## Tone & Neutrality

### 6. Avoid Ideological Framing

Don't characterize regulations or policies with politically loaded terms.

- Wrong: "regulation is light"
- Right: "regulation is consistent and not overbearing"

Neutral alternatives: "consistent," "streamlined," "transparent," "evolving." If ideology matters, explore it in a follow-up, not the setup.

### 7. Cut Words That Impute Motive

Describe effects, not intent. If misconduct matters, ask about it directly.

- Wrong: "deceptive plans and confusing pricing structures"
- Right: "confusing pricing structures"

"Confusing" describes an effect. "Deceptive" accuses intent.

### 8. Replace Negative Judgments with Forward-Looking Language

- Wrong: "where the market is failing consumers"
- Right: "where the market needs to improve"
- Wrong: "what's broken"
- Right: "what's next"

Keeps the journalism without the adversarial tone.

### 9. Validate Before Questioning (Policy Positions)

If the guest has taken a deliberate policy stand, acknowledge the reasoning before probing.

- Wrong: "That's going to worry rural Texans. Why is that the right call?"
- Right: "While that's clearly a program that has long outlived its original need and purpose, what do you see as the likely future options?"

Removes defensiveness. Signals you did homework.

## Question Architecture

### 10. No Disguised Yes/No Questions

Binary choices disguised as open questions close off nuance.

- Wrong: "Is the current model sustainable, or does the state need to push harder on consolidation?"
- Right: "How do we balance the independence of these water systems against the strong push to modernize and consolidate them?"

Real open questions leave room for a third answer.

### 11. Use "We" to Signal Collaboration

- Wrong: "What should the state do about..."
- Right: "How do we balance..."

Makes the guest a thinking partner, not a defendant.

### 12. Ask for Strategy, Not Sufficiency

Don't ask if someone has enough. Ask how they're solving the constraint.

- Wrong: "Do you have enough people to keep pace?"
- Right: "What are you doing with technology to ensure you keep pace?"

The former implies failure. The latter invites showcase.

### 13. Ask for Challenges, Not Catastrophes

- Wrong: "What's the strategic risk if Texas moves too fast and connects load before generation exists?"
- Right: "What are the challenges that might force such a slowdown?"

Guests open up about obstacles. They clam up about hypothetical disasters.

## Language & Polish

### 14. Aspiration Over Judgment

- Wrong: "what's the one metric that tells you whether you got it right?"
- Right: "what's the one outcome that you most hope to have achieved?"

Judgment is binary. Aspiration is human. The latter generates better answers.

### 15. Cut Legacy/Era Language

- Wrong: "the Gleeson era at the PUC"
- Right: "your service at the PUC"

Let the listener decide if there was an era. Don't pre-write the guest's Wikipedia entry.

### 16. No Gotchas Disguised as Flattery

- Wrong: "You already knew where the bodies were buried."
- Right: "How does that institutional memory change how you lead?"

An accusation wearing a compliment is still an accusation.

### 17. Don't Over-Specify Examples in Questions

Let the guest own the examples. Over-directing narrows their answer.

- Wrong: "help a family in Fort Worth actually compare apples to apples"
- Right: "help families compare apples to apples"

### 18. Soften Accusatory Qualifiers Consistently

Every word signals tone. Choose collaborative over adversarial across the full script, not just in isolated questions.

| Instead of | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| failing consumers | needs to improve |
| regulation is light | regulation is consistent |
| exposing ratepayers to risks | balancing competing needs |
| why is that the right call | what do you see as future options |
