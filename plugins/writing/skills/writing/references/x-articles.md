# X Articles (Long-Form)

## Why Articles Over Blog Links

- Keep users on-platform (better dwell time)
- Algorithm treats them as native content, no link penalty
- Permanent placement on profile, searchable
- Full formatting: headers, embedded media, rich text

## When to Use Articles vs Posts

| Use Articles When | Use Posts When |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Content exceeds 500 words | Quick take, single insight |
| Deep analysis or investigation | Provocative hook |
| Would otherwise be a blog link | Breaking commentary |
| Evergreen reference material | Time-sensitive reaction |

## Structure

- **Strong headline**: Specific, sparks curiosity, promises value (see [headlines.md](headlines.md) for formulas and testing data)
- **Compelling first paragraph**: Hook immediately, no throat-clearing
- **Subheadings every 200-300 words**: For skimmability
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences max
- **Bullet points**: For lists, comparisons, key data
- **Header image**: Visually relevant, high quality

## Writing Style

- Conversational tone, not formal academic
- Use "you" and "your"
- Evidence after every claim (data, story, example, comparison)
- Mix specific numbers with analysis
- Institutional voice for B2B (no "I think" unless personal brand)

## Promotion

Articles need dedicated posts to drive traffic. The article itself won't appear in feeds without promotion.

Post template for promoting an article:
```
[Provocative hook from the article's strongest insight]

[1-2 sentences of context]

[Closing line that makes people want the full picture]

Full analysis: [article link]
```

## Editing Process

First draft is for you. Second and third drafts are for the reader. Edit for:
- Clarity (can someone skim and get 80% of the value?)
- Flow (does each section lead naturally to the next?)
- Evidence (is every claim backed?)
- Energy (does the writing speed up and slow down, or drone?)
