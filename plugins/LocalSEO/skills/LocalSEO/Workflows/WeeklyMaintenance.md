# Weekly SEO Maintenance

Recurring tasks to maintain and improve local search rankings. Do these consistently for 6 months and you will not recognize your business.

## Weekly Checklist

### GBP (Google Business Profile)
- [ ] Upload a new photo to GBP
- [ ] Post a GBP update with keyword + city name
- [ ] Respond to any new reviews (should be within 24 hours, but catch stragglers here)

### Website Health
- [ ] Check for 404 errors (use Google Search Console or crawl tool)
- [ ] Verify key pages are still indexed (`site:domain.com/page`)

### Reviews
- [ ] Confirm review requests went out to recent customers
- [ ] Check review count trend (are you gaining?)

### Link Building
- [ ] Identify one link building opportunity (local directory, partner, sponsor, press)
- [ ] Focus links to homepage (80-90% of all links)
- [ ] Use branded anchor text

## Monthly Additions

- [ ] Full indexing check across all important pages
- [ ] Citation audit (NAP consistency across Yelp, BBB, YellowPages, etc.)
- [ ] Competitor category check (are the top 3 above you still using the same category?)
- [ ] Review GBP insights for trends

## Tracking

Keep a simple log:
