# Full Local SEO Audit

Run through every section below. For each item, report: PASS, FAIL, or N/A with a note.

## 1. Website On-Page

- [ ] **Address in footer** - Physical address visible in site footer
- [ ] **Phone above the fold** - Phone number visible without scrolling
- [ ] **Meta titles front-load keyword** - Primary keyword appears at the start of meta titles
- [ ] **H1 = keyword + city** - Each service page H1 includes the target keyword and city name
- [ ] **Clean, readable URL slugs** - URLs should be human-readable for trust and CTR. Do NOT recommend restructuring URLs for keyword placement (near-zero ranking impact per Google's John Mueller and Backlinko data). Only flag genuinely unreadable URLs (random IDs, `/page-3` style)
- [ ] **No duplicate keyword pages** - No two pages target the same keyword (Google will rank neither)
- [ ] **No "how to" content** - Content targets "service + city" keywords, not informational "how to" queries
- [ ] **No blog posts** (for local businesses) - Stop publishing blog content; focus on service/location pages

## 2. Technical Health

- [ ] **Site is indexed** - Verify with `site:domain.com` in Google. If pages aren't indexed, nothing else matters
- [ ] **No 404 errors** - Check for broken pages (should be checked weekly)
- [ ] **Listed on Bing** - Submit to Bing Places. LLMs pull from Bing

## 3. Google Business Profile (GBP)

- [ ] **GBP links to location page** - Not homepage. Link to the specific location/service page
- [ ] **Category matches competitors** - Business category matches the top 3 ranking above you
- [ ] **Products section filled out** - Even for service businesses, fill the products section
- [ ] **Recent photo uploaded** - At least one new photo in the last 7 days
- [ ] **Recent update posted** - GBP update includes keyword + location
- [ ] **All reviews responded to** - Every review has a response, within 24 hours

## 4. Citations & Links

- [ ] **Core citations built** - Listed on: Yelp, BBB, YellowPages, Uber, local Chamber of Commerce
- [ ] **Link building to homepage** - 80-90% of backlinks point to homepage
- [ ] **Branded anchor text** - Anchor text uses brand name (safest and most effective)

## 5. Ongoing Habits

These aren't one-time fixes. They need to happen consistently:

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Upload new GBP photo | Weekly |
| Post GBP update (keyword + location) | Weekly |
| Respond to reviews | Within 24 hours |
| Ask customers for reviews | Every single one |
| Check for 404 errors | Weekly |
| Verify indexing | Monthly |

## 6. Keyword Validation

When recommending new pages or content during an audit, validate that the target keyword matches real search behavior before recommending it:

- [ ] **SERP test** - Search the exact keyword in Google. Results dominated by local competitors and directories = valid. Results showing DIY sites, forms, or unrelated content = weak keyword.
- [ ] **People Also Ask check** - PAA questions should align with the service being offered. If PAA is all DIY/informational, the keyword attracts researchers not buyers.
- [ ] **Competitor page check** - Do 3+ local competitors have a dedicated page for this keyword? If yes, validated. If zero, it's either a gap or nobody searches for it — investigate which.
- [ ] **AI query alignment** - Would someone ask ChatGPT or Google AI this question? If yes, FAQ sections can capture AI-generated answer traffic.
- [ ] **Recommend fold vs. standalone** - If a keyword fails validation, recommend folding that content into a stronger parent page as a section rather than creating a standalone page nobody will find.

## Output Format

After auditing, provide:

1. **Score** - X/20 items passing
2. **Critical fixes** - Items that block ranking (indexing, 404s, duplicate pages)
3. **Quick wins** - Items fixable in under an hour
4. **Ongoing gaps** - Habits not yet established
5. **Action plan** - Prioritized next steps (with keyword validation for any new page recommendations)
