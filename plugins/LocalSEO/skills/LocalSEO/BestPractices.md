# Local SEO Best Practices

The rules behind the checklists. Reference this when making SEO decisions.

## On-Page Rules

1. **Front-load your keyword in meta titles** - The primary keyword should appear at the start of the title tag, not buried at the end.

2. **H1 = keyword + city** - Every service page's H1 should include both the target keyword and the city name. Example: "Kitchen Remodeling in Austin, TX"

3. **Descriptive URL slugs** - Google should understand what the page is about just by reading the slug. `/kitchen-remodeling-austin` not `/services/page-3`

4. **No duplicate keyword targeting** - Never build two pages targeting the same keyword. Google will rank neither. One keyword, one page.

5. **Address in the footer** - Your physical address should appear in the site footer on every page.

6. **Phone number above the fold** - Visible without scrolling. Make it easy for people to call.

7. **Target "service + city" keywords, not "how to"** - You want buyers, not browsers. "plumber austin tx" not "how to fix a leaky faucet"

8. **Stop writing blog posts** (local businesses) - Blog content attracts informational intent. Service and location pages attract buyer intent. Focus on what converts.

## Google Business Profile (GBP) Rules

9. **Link GBP to your location page, not your homepage** - The GBP website link should point to the specific location or primary service page.

10. **Match your category to competitors** - Your business category should match what the top 3 people ranking above you are using.

11. **Fill out the products section** - Even if you're a service business. Use it to list your services with descriptions and pricing.

12. **Upload a new photo every single week** - Consistency signals activity to Google. One new relevant photo per week minimum.

13. **Include keyword + location in every GBP update** - Every post should naturally include your primary service keyword and your city.

14. **Respond to every review within 24 hours** - Every single one. Good or bad. Speed matters.

15. **Ask every single customer for a review** - Not some. Every single one. Make it part of your process.

## Technical Rules

16. **Make sure your site is indexed** - Check with `site:yourdomain.com` in Google. If Google can't find your pages, nothing else matters.

17. **Check for 404 errors weekly** - Broken pages hurt rankings and waste link equity.

18. **Get listed on Bing** - LLMs are pulling from Bing. Submit to Bing Places for Business.

## Citations & Link Building Rules

19. **Build citations on core platforms** - Yelp, BBB, YellowPages, Uber, and your local Chamber of Commerce. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be consistent everywhere.

20. **Build links to your homepage first** - 80-90% of backlinks should point to your homepage.

21. **Use branded anchor text** - It's the safest and most effective form of link building. Your brand name as the link text.

## The Timeline

Do all of this consistently for **6 months** and you will not recognize your business. There are no shortcuts. Consistency is the strategy.
