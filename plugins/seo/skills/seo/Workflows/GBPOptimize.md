# Google Business Profile Optimization

Checklist for auditing and optimizing a Google Business Profile for local search ranking.

## Category & Setup

- [ ] **Business category** matches the top 3 competitors ranking above you
- [ ] **GBP links to location/service page**, NOT homepage
- [ ] **Products section** is filled out (even for service businesses - use it to list services with descriptions and pricing)

## Content & Media

- [ ] **New photo uploaded this week** - Upload at least one new, relevant photo every single week
- [ ] **Recent GBP update posted** - Every update should include your primary keyword AND your city/location
- [ ] **All business info is accurate** - Hours, phone, address, website URL

## Reviews

- [ ] **Every review has a response** - Respond within 24 hours, no exceptions
- [ ] **Active review generation** - Ask every single customer for a review. Every single one.
- [ ] **Review responses include keywords naturally** - "Thank you for choosing [service] in [city]..."

## GBP Updates Strategy

Post updates that include:
1. Your primary service keyword
2. Your city/location name
3. A photo when possible
4. A call to action

Example: "Just completed another [kitchen remodel] project in [Austin, TX]. Contact us for a free estimate!"

## Output

Report on each section with PASS/FAIL and specific recommendations.
