# Local SEO: GBP, Citations, NAP & Reviews

## Google Business Profile (GBP)

### Category & Setup
- [ ] **Business category** matches the top 3 competitors ranking above you
- [ ] **GBP links to location/service page**, NOT homepage (unless single-location)
- [ ] **Products/Services section** is filled out (even for service businesses — use it to list services with descriptions and pricing)
- [ ] Business name matches website exactly (no keyword stuffing — suspension risk)
- [ ] Address and phone match website NAP exactly
- [ ] Business hours are current and accurate
- [ ] Business description filled with keywords naturally
- [ ] Attributes filled out (accessibility, amenities, etc.)

### Content & Media
- [ ] **New photo uploaded this week** — at least one new, relevant photo every single week
- [ ] **Recent GBP update posted** — every update should include primary keyword AND city/location
- [ ] Post frequency: 2-3 posts/week ideal
- [ ] Q&A section has owner-generated questions and answers

### Reviews
- [ ] **Every review has a response** — respond within 24 hours, no exceptions
- [ ] **Active review generation** — ask every single customer for a review. Systematize with follow-up emails, QR codes, SMS.
- [ ] **Review velocity maintained** — consistent new reviews matter more than total count. Review velocity is a live ranking signal; rankings drop when generation stops. Reviews account for ~20% of local pack ranking weight.
- [ ] **Review text quality** — reviews mentioning specific services and locations carry more ranking weight. Coach customers to mention the service they received and their city.
- [ ] **Review responses include keywords naturally** — "Thank you for choosing [service] in [city]..."

### Behavioral Signals
- [ ] Clicks to directions, calls from profile, website clicks, and message inquiries are all ranking signals
- [ ] An active, engaging profile outranks a passive one
- [ ] "Business open at search time" is a top-5 local ranking factor (Whitespark 2026)

### GBP Updates Strategy

Post updates that include:
1. Your primary service keyword
2. Your city/location name
3. A photo when possible
4. A call to action

Example: "Just completed another [kitchen remodel] project in [Austin, TX]. Contact us for a free estimate!"

### Service Area Businesses (SABs)
- [ ] Service areas defined precisely (20 zip codes/cities you actually serve — Google verifies claims)
- [ ] Business address hidden from public if home-based
- [ ] No service area abuse — don't claim coverage you can't actually serve (suspension risk)
- [ ] Unique service area pages per major city with this structure: H1 ("Service in City"), local testimonials, city-specific details (climate, building codes, local issues), service breakdown, location-specific FAQ
- [ ] Each service area page has genuinely unique content (not city-name swaps — Google spam updates target these)

## Citations & Directory Listings

Citations have shifted from "ranking fuel" to **verification layer** — businesses with consistent citations perform 18x stronger in local search. For AI search, 3 of top 4 visibility factors are citation-related (Whitespark 2026).

### Essential Listings
- [ ] **Bing Places** (LLMs pull from Bing — critical for ChatGPT visibility)
- [ ] **Apple Business Connect** (Siri integration — 86.5M US users)
- [ ] Yelp with complete profile
- [ ] BBB (Better Business Bureau)
- [ ] YellowPages
- [ ] Local Chamber of Commerce
- [ ] Industry-specific directories (highest value tier)
- [ ] "Best of" lists and awards (expert-curated lists are #1 AI citation factor)

### Citation Quality Hierarchy
- **Tier 1 (highest value):** Industry-specific directories (Justia for legal, Angie's for contractors), authoritative general directories (Yelp, Apple Maps, Bing), expert-curated "Best of" lists, quality news/press mentions, professional association memberships
- **Tier 2 (moderate value):** Local business directories, city guides, white pages, social media profiles with complete info
- **Tier 3 (lower value):** Auto-populated directories, low-authority or spam directories (avoid these)

### NAP Consistency
- [ ] NAP (Name, Address, Phone) is identical across ALL citations (exact match, no variations)
- [ ] No duplicate listings on any platform
- [ ] Audit NAP consistency quarterly

## Google Spam Warnings

Flag these during audits — Google is actively penalizing:

- **Keyword-stuffed business names** — "Best Plumber in Denver - 24/7 Emergency" instead of legal name. Suspension risk.
- **Fake addresses** — Virtual offices or fake storefronts to game proximity. Algorithmic demotion or suspension.
- **Phone number spoofing** — Using local area codes that don't match actual location.
- **Service area abuse** — Claiming coverage you can't actually serve.
- **Review manipulation** — Fake reviews, paid reviews, review exchange schemes. Stricter enforcement in 2025+.
- **Thin city pages** — Generic content with city-name swaps. Spam update target.
- **NAP inconsistencies** — Same business with different name/address/phone across platforms.

Google's 2025 enforcement is significantly stricter: more aggressive spam profile filtering, higher suspension risk, algorithmic demotion without warning, and tighter review authentication (especially for SABs).

## Ongoing Habits

These aren't one-time fixes. They need to happen consistently:

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Upload new GBP photo | Weekly |
| Post GBP update (keyword + location) | 2-3x per week |
| Respond to reviews | Within 24 hours |
| Ask customers for reviews (coach them to mention service + city) | Every single one |
| Check for 404 errors | Weekly |
| Verify indexing | Monthly |
| Update top content with new data/examples | Quarterly |
| Audit NAP consistency across citations | Quarterly |

Do all of this consistently for **6 months** and you will not recognize your business. There are no shortcuts. Consistency is the strategy.
