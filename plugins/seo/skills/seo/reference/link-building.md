# Link Building & Authority

Backlinks remain a core ranking factor but the game has shifted: **topical relevance beats raw domain authority**. A link from a DR 40 site in your niche can outperform a DR 80 link with no thematic connection. For AI search, backlinks matter primarily through organic ranking performance — 92% of AI Overview citations come from domains already in the top 10.

## Link Profile Assessment

- [ ] **Balanced homepage vs deep page links** — natural profiles mix both. Heavily homepage-concentrated profiles are a red flag. Deep links to service/landing pages build topical authority for specific terms.
- [ ] **Anchor text distribution is safe** — 30-50% branded, 20-30% partial-match, <10% exact-match keywords. Over-optimized exact-match anchors trigger Penguin penalties.
- [ ] No spammy or irrelevant backlinks (PBNs, paid links, link exchanges, directory spam)
- [ ] Internal linking strategy connects service pages to homepage (see audit checklist B4 for detailed internal linking)
- [ ] **Link reclamation performed** — 66.5% of backlinks across top sites point to 404 pages. Identify broken backlinks and create 301 redirects. Unlinked brand mentions converted to links (25%+ conversion rate). Faster ROI than new link building.
- [ ] Competitor backlink sources identified for prospecting (use Link Intersect to find sites linking to competitors but not you)
- [ ] **Link velocity is natural** — new sites: 5-10 links/month initially. Established sites: +5-14.5% monthly growth in referring domains. Sudden spikes trigger scrutiny; consistent pace is safe.
- [ ] **Original research and data-driven content** created as link magnets — original research earns 8x more backlinks than curated/opinion content. 90%+ of successful digital PR campaigns use data-led content.
- [ ] **Nofollow/sponsored/UGC attributes** used correctly on outbound links — Google treats these as "hints" not strict exclusions; they may still pass some value

## Link Building Tactics (Prioritized)

1. **Digital PR** — most effective tactic (48.6% of SEOs rank it #1). Expert commentary, original data studies, newsworthy angles. Cost: $10K-$50K/quarter for agencies; DIY via HARO/Connectively for editorial links at low cost.
2. **HARO/Connectively** — revived April 2025 with original format. Best cost-to-quality ratio for natural editorial links. Relationship-building outreach gets 25-30% response rate vs 1-2% for templates.
3. **Guest posting** — quality over quantity. Strategic placement on topically relevant, authoritative sites. $150-$400 per editorial placement.
4. **Broken link building** — find broken outbound links on relevant sites, offer your content as replacement.
5. **Resource page outreach** — works best in niche industries with curated resource lists.

## Content Types That Earn Links

- **Original research/data studies** — 8x more backlinks than curated content
- **Infographics** — +178% link increase; 29% of sites prefer linking to infographics over lengthy articles
- **Interactive tools** — calculators, assessments, comparison engines earn natural links
- **Definitive guides** — comprehensive, authoritative reference content
- **"Why" and "What" posts** — 25.8% more links than how-to guides or videos

## Local Link Building

Local links are weighted differently than national — proximity and relevance matter more. Google's Helpful Content system rewards genuine community participation.

- [ ] **Sponsorships** — local events, sports teams, nonprofits, charity auctions (organizers link to sponsor pages). Often overlooked but high ROI: local authority + community goodwill.
- [ ] **Local media outreach** — pitch newsworthy angles to local papers/outlets (highest authority + local relevance). Angles that work: community initiatives, industry awards, free services for nonprofits/seniors, local data or trends.
- [ ] **Business partnerships** — cross-promotional content with complementary businesses (landscaper + pool company, painter + realtor)
- [ ] **Chamber of Commerce membership** and professional association listings — geo-relevant, authoritative backlinks
- [ ] **Community involvement** documented on website and linked from event pages
- [ ] **Event hosting** — free workshops, webinars, community events generate links from promotional sites

## Brand Signals

Brand search volume is the strongest predictor of AI citations (r=0.334), stronger than backlink count (r=0.37).

- [ ] Brand name searches are growing (or at minimum, exist)
- [ ] Social profiles exist and link to website
- [ ] Wikipedia or knowledge panel presence (if applicable)
- [ ] Brand mentioned in community discussions (forums, Reddit, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent brand presentation across all platforms
- [ ] **Entity consistency** — same brand name, author names, and identifiers across all web properties. AI systems use entity matching to build confidence.
- [ ] **Third-party presence** — brand visible on authoritative sites beyond your own (press mentions, industry publications, expert-curated lists). Sites with 32K+ referring domains are 3.5x more likely to be cited by ChatGPT.
